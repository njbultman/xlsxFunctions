Description: Excel Functions in R
    This package holds a suite of function names that you would commonly use in Microsoft Excel. 
    Oftentimes, it can be difficult to transition to a different technology because one has to 
    learn the names of new functions and their parameters. I attempt to make this transition 
    easier by providing commonly used functions in this package that are from Microsoft 
    Excel and able to be implemented in R.
